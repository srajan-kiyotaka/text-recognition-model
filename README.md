# Text Recognition Model

Train a text recognition model that extracts textual information from images using the Tesseract module.

# About

The above script is a Python program that uses the `Tesseract OCR` (Optical Character Recognition) engine and the `Python Imaging Library (PIL)` to extract text from an image. The program performs the following steps:

- Imports the `pytesseract` and `Image` modules. `pytesseract` is the `wrapper` for the `Tesseract OCR` engine, and Image is a module from the PIL that provides functions for opening and manipulating images.

- Opens an image file and converts it to `grayscale` using the `Image.open` and `.convert` methods. Converting the image to `grayscale` can improve the accuracy of text recognition.

- Calls the `pytesseract.image_to_string` function, passing it the `grayscale` image, to extract the text from the image.

- Prints the extracted text using the `print` function.

## Note
Note that the accuracy of text recognition using the Tesseract module can be improved by pre-processing the image and providing appropriate configuration options to the image_to_string function. You can find more information on how to use the Tesseract module and improve its accuracy in the official documentation: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/
